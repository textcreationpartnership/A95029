         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Petitioners doe much rejoyce in the happy Concurrence of both Houſes of Parliament, as in other
things, ſo eſpecially, in that moſt neceſſary <hi>Ordinance</hi> touching the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdome, and Dominion of <hi>Wales;</hi>
Whereunto the Petitioners doe moſt humbly and cheerfully ſubmit, for the ſafety of His Majeſty, the Parliament
and Kingdome: For the ordering whereof many preſſing Petitions from moſt parts of the Kingdome have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
in this time of imminent Dangers, proceeding from the bloody Councells of Papiſts and others, ill affected
to the honour, peace and proſperity of our moſt gracious King, and his Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>And the Petitioners doe likewiſe humbly returne all poſſible thanks unto this Honourable Houſe, for the great
honour and high favour vouchſafed, in giving them leave to nominate the Perſons to whom the <hi>Militia</hi> of this City ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And for accepting and approving of the Nomination and return made to this Honourable Houſe, by the Petitioners on that behalfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this their joy is much diſturbed and interrupted by an untrue, unadviſed, and dangerous Petition, intituled,</hi> The Petition of the
Citizens of London, whoſe names are under written, <hi>directed and delivered, in</hi> February <hi>laſt,</hi> To the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament;
<hi>And ſince publiſhed in Print, with this Title,</hi> The humble Petition of the Citizens of London: <hi>Thereby to publiſh it through the Kingdome,
as the Petition of all the Citizens: Wherein is ſet forth (as appeareth by one of thoſe Printed Copies annexed that</hi> the ordering of the
Armes of London hath time out of mind, been annexed to the Maioralty of the ſaid City; That the conferring thereof upon others would reflect upon the
government and Cuſtomes of this City granted by the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> and confirmed by divers Acts and Charters ſince that time; and which
every Freeman of the ſaid City is by the Oath of his freedome bound to maintaine to the utmoſt of his power; And that ſuch Alteration in the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
might breed great diſtractions and inconveniencies: <hi>or to this effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor this alone, but the Petitioners are yet more deeply wounded and grieved, by the preſumptuous boldneſſe of the Publiſhers of the
ſaid Petition in Print, by joyning therwith His Majeſties Anſwer and denyall, Intituled <hi>His Majeſties Meſsage to both Houſes of Parliament,
February</hi> 28 1641. Which Anſwer (as the Petitiones humbly conceive) was grounded upon the ſaid Petition, and miſinformation of ſome
perſons, ill affected to His Majeſty and to the City, Who have thereby, and otherwiſe, often endeavoured to make diviſions betwixt the
King and the Parliament; betwixt the Parliament and the City; and betwixt the Citizens among themſelves, to the intollerable abuſe of
his ſacred Majeſty, and of all his loyall Subjects.</p>
                  <p>And they verily beleeve, that this bold publiſhing in Print, of the ſaid Petition, and his Majeſties Meſſage (which ſhortly after followed
the exhibiting of the ſaid Petition) together in one printed paper, was purpoſely done, wickedly and ſeditiouſly, to make diviſions as
aforeſaid, to beget an opinion throughout the Kingdome, that the City of <hi>London</hi> doth not intend to conforme unto but complaine of,
and oppoſe the aforeſaid Ordinance, and to make the ſaid Petition a deſperate preſident to the reſt of the Kingdome, to doe the like;
Thereby to hinder the cheerfull, needfull, lawfull, and unanimous Concurrence of the Kingdome, in yeelding due, full, and timely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the ſaid <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They doe therfore humbly pray, That this Honourable Houſe will vouchſafe</p>

                     <item>1. To beleeve, that neither this nor any other Petition of the like kinde ever came from the Petitioners, nor was framed, contrived or approved of by
them. And that they doe wholly and with deteſtation diſavow and diſclaime the ſame as an untrue, unadviſed, and dangerous Petition.</item>
                     <item>2. To put a difference betweene the Authors, Contrivers, Promoters, Adviſers, Publiſhers and Printers of it, and ſuch, as it ſhall appeare to this
Honourable Houſe, were by ſubtilty drawne in unawares to ſubſcribe the ſame, without any malignant intention, and ſhall clearely and fully acknowledge
their error, and raſhnes therein; And that this latter ſort may have ſuch lawfull favour as may ſtand with the honour and Iuſtice of the high Court of
Parliament.</item>
                     <item>Laſtly, they doe humbly pray, that this Honourable Houſe will ſtill encreaſe their joy, by endeavouring to uphold &amp; continue, by all good meanes
that bleſſed concurrence of both Houſes of Parliament, in all your great affaires and effectually to proceed againſt all diſturbers and undermyners ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and that ſhall endeavour to beget or cheriſh any miſunderſtanding, or to make diviſion betwixt the King and Parliament, whom God and the Lawes
of this Land have vnited in ſo neere a Relation.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And they ſhall ever be ready to aſſiſt and ſtand by this Honourable Houſe therein, with their Lives and Eſtates, to the utmoſt of their Power,
